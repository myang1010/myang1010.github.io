        <p>This is a one time session hosted by Hack Reactor. I chose this class because I wanted to know more about UX design. The title why it is so important attracted me.</p>
        <p>Some benefits from this session,</p>
        <p>What's User Experince Design?</p>
        <p>"User experince encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products."</p>
        <p>User Experince(UX) desgin is the process desgin teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant
            experinces to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, 
            including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

        <h2>Leave Photoshop Behind: Free, Online Alternatives for Image Creation and Editing</h2>
        <p>Code Cafe: Hosted by Code Cafe Coding and Tech at Indianapolis Public Library</p>
        <p>Here's <a href= "https://www.meetup.com/join-code-cafe/events/277197665" target="_self">the link for this record</a></p>

            <figcaption>This is the screenshot</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>For this one, I couldn't take the screenshot of me attending the class. The host didn't show that page,
            and I minimize the host window. If you look carefully you could see the "Talking: Henry Herbst-Indy PL" 
            text on the upper right corner. That's the Librarian Henry Herbst from Indianapolis Public Library who was giving the class.

        <p>It's inetresting to learn some free and easy to use photoshop tools. In this session the librarianin introduced two awesome tools,
            one is Pixlr, and the other one is Photopea. They are free, online alternatives for image
            creation and editing.
        </p>
        <p>Why not Photoshop? 
            Because Photoshop is incredibly expensive! It requires a monthly subscription fee in order to use and a lot of unnecessary features for most</p>

        <p>Some Common Terms:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Canvas</dt><dd>the window that holds an image</dd> 
            <dt>Layer</dt><dd>each one is like a separate sheet of paper; the one on top obscures the one below</dd>
            <dt>Crop</dt><dd>trim a portion of an image</dd>
            <dt>Filter</dt><dd>automated way to alter an image (like blurring or coloring it)</dd>
        </dl>   

        <p>Pixlr</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More suited for image-editing and collages</li>
            <li>User-oriented; offers templates and stock images</li>
            <li>Two versions! Both are online. Both are free.</li>
            <li>Pixlr X for beginners, simplified and intuitive</li>
            <li>Pixlr E for more experienced users who want better control</li>
        </ul>   
        <p>Here is the Pixlr Resources:
            <a href="https://blog.pixlr.com/support/" target="_self">Pixlr FAQ</a>      
        </p> 
        <p>Photopea</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Similar functionality as Photoshop</li>
            <li>Many of the filters and options of Photoshop</li>
            <li>Including the ability to adjust lighting and color</li>
            <li>Compatible with a wide variety of image files</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is the Photopea Resources:
            <a href="https://www.photopea.com/learn/" target="_self">Learn</a> Photopea 
            and <a href="https://www.photopea.com/tuts/">Tutorials</a>
        </p>
        <p>Personally I like Photopea better.</p>
