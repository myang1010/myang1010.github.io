<p>Hi there, my name is Ming King. This is my second HTML/CSS class with Professor Claudia Da Silva.</p>
<p>So far, I've taken classes like Java, Linux, SQL, Python currently working on JavaScript and HTML/CSS. 
    My favorite websit is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a>.
    Because I can always get inspiring or right answer from it.</p>
  <p>The rise of the internet within mainstream culture is largely correlated with its history as a visual medium. 
      The idea of the internet had existed in some form for at least a half a century before it finally became a common household utility in the 1990s. 
      The web advanced a great deal in the years following the tech crash of 2000â€“2001. 
      Let's take a look at <a href = "https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development#the-turn-of-the-century" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the turn of the web development</a> after the tech crash.</p>
