  <img src="house.png" alt="purple drop" class="house">
  <p>This is a paragraph that will start on the right side of the house 
      as the house has received the CSS class of house and that class 
      has the float:left CSS property being applied to it. The idea is 
      that we will modify that class to include CSS shape and you will 
      see that the these two paragraphs will then follow the shape of that house, 
      following the curve of the house instead of just following a rectangular shape 
      of the width and height of the image.</p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph and this paragraph will also follow the float of 
      the image until the end of its height. When the height of the image is achieved, 
      the paragraph will then continue normally starting from the left of the browser 
      and continuing to the right and down.</p>
