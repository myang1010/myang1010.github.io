            <h3>How to make white sugar sponge cake</h3>
            <p>Ingredients:<br>
            150 g rice flour (1 1/4 cups)<br>
            80 g water (plus 200g, divided; note that when measuring water, g = ml)<br>
            100 g white granulated sugar (1/2 cup)<br>
            3 g active dry yeast (about 1 teaspoon; can substitute instant yeast)<br>
            30 g lukewarm water (30 ml; about 2 tablespoons)<br>
            vegetable oil (for brushing)<br>
            </p>
            <p>Steps:<br>
            1. In a heat proof mixing bowl, mix the rice flour with 80g (80 ml) water to form large clumps. Set aside.<br>
            2. In a small pot, add the sugar and 200g water. Bring to a boil and stir just until the sugar is completely dissolved. Turn off the heat and immediately pour the boiling sugar water into the clumped rice mixture. Whisk for a few minutes, until smooth (there should be no lumps). The mixture will look like a thin batter. Cool until lukewarm.<br>
            3. While the mixture is cooling, dissolve 3g active dry yeast (or instant yeast) into 2 tablespoons lukewarm water. Let stand for 15 minutes so the yeast can bloom.<br>
            4. When the rice mixture is lukewarm and the yeast has activated, stir the yeast mixture into the batter and whisk for 3 minutes.<br>
            5. Cover the bowl with an overturned plate, and allow it to ferment in a warm place for at least 3 hours. I left mine inside the microwave with a large mug of boiled water sitting next to it and the door closed. After each hour, I replaced the mug of water with another mug of boiling water to keep the environment warm.<br>
            6. In the last 10 minutes of fermentation, prepare your steamer, and make sure there’s enough water in it to last for 20 minutes of steaming over high heat.<br>
            7. After the 3 hours of fermentation are complete, you’ll see foamy bubbles have formed on the surface of your batter. Turn on the heat to boil the water in the steamer.<br>
            8. Pour the rice mixture into a 8" to 9" pie pan or other shallow heatproof dish that will fit inside your steamer. When the water is at a rolling boil, carefully place the dish into the steamer, cover, and steam for 20 minutes on high heat.<br>
            9. After 20 minutes, turn off the heat but do not uncover the steamer. Let the cake rest for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, you may open the lid and remove the cake from the steamer.<br>  
            10.Brush the top of the cake lightly with vegetable oil to give it a nice shine and keep it moist. Allow it to cool on the counter before cutting. Brush your knife with oil before slicing. Serve.<br>
